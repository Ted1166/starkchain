Sustainable Supply Chain Tracking Plartfom.

## Description

This Platform is a blockchain-based solution designed to enhance transparency and promote sustainability in supply chains. By leveraging StarkNet's technology, the platform records and verifies every step of a product's journey from origin to consumer, ensuring ethical practices and sustainability standards are met. This empowers consumers to make informed purchasing decisions and encourages businesses to adopt sustainable practices.

## problems 

Modern supply chains are complex and opaques making it difficult for consumers to verify the  ethical and sustainable practices of the profuct they purchase. Isseus do include:
   - **Lack of Transparency**: Consumers have limited visibility into the journey of products from origin to purchase leading to uncertainty about the ethical and sustainable practiced involved.
   - **Fraudulent Certifications**: It can be challenging to verify the authenticity of sustainability certifications, as fraudulent certificates and greenwashing practices are prevalent.
   - **Inefficient Data Management**: Traditional supply chain systems rely on centralized databases, which are prone to errors, data tampering, and inefficiencies.
   - **Limited Consumer Engagement**: Consumers often lack incentives to choose sustainably sourced products, and there is no easy way for them to provide feedback or engage with the supply chain.

## Solutions

1. **Blockchain Technology**: By leveraging StarkNet's blockchain, the system creates an immutable and transparent record of each product's journey. Every transaction and movement within the supply chain is recorded on the blockchain, making it impossible to alter or tamper with data.
2. **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts automate the recording of supply chain events, ensuring accurate and real-time data capture without manual intervention.
3. **Partnerships with Certification Bodies**: The platform partners with recognized sustainability certification bodies to validate and record certifications on the blockchain. This ensures that only authentic and verified certifications are associated with products.
4. **Digital Certificates**: Digital certificates are issued and stored on the blockchain, providing consumers with easy access to verified sustainability information. This eliminates the risk of fraudulent certifications and greenwashing practices.
5. **Decentralized Ledger**: The decentralized nature of the blockchain ensures that data is distributed across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of data loss or tampering. This enhances the overall security and reliability of supply chain data.
6. **IoT Integration**: IoT devices such as sensors and RFID tags are integrated into the supply chain to automatically capture and transmit data to the blockchain. This reduces manual data entry errors and ensures accurate tracking of products.
7. **Mobile App**: A user-friendly mobile app allows consumers to scan product codes, view detailed supply chain information, and claim rewards. This enhances consumer engagement and empowers them to make informed decisions.
8. **Rewards System**: The platform implements a rewards system where consumers earn tokens or discounts for purchasing sustainably sourced products. This incentivizes ethical consumption and encourages consumers to make sustainable choices.
